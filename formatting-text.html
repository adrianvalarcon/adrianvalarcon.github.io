	<!-- Headlines -->
	<h1>This is an example of a Headline. It is encapsulated using the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.</h1>
	
	<h2>Similarly this is also a Headline; however, it is smaller than the first and is typically used as a SubHeader. It is encapsulated using the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code>.</h2>
	
	<!-- Paragraphs, Code, pre, and br -->
	<p>This is an example of a paragraph. It is encapsulated using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.<br>To create breaks in a paragraph we use the "break tag." And it looks a little something like this <code>&lt;br&gt;.</code></p>
	
	<p>You could also break paragraphs up by writing several different paragraph [elements?]</p> <!-- Check this out later owo' -->
	
	<!-- Bold and Italics -->	
	<p>When you need emphasis you can use the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;em&gt;to show <b>bolds</b> and <em>emphasis</em>.<br>However, keep in mind that there is also another form of italics denoted by &lt;i&gt;. This is using &lt;em&gt;and &lt;i&gt; side-by-side so you can see the difference: <em>emphasis</em> and <i>italics.</i></p>
