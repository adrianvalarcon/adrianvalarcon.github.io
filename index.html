	<p>This site is made using a combination of Adobe Dreamweaver and GitHub Pages :)<br>
	<br>This is going to be a long-term personal project where I will practice my HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I eventually plan to turn this into a personal blog of sorts. And maybe even a portfolio of my photography + website design. Anyway thanks for reading and ttyl :))</p>
